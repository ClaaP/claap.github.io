		<p>Hello! Today you will be my Guardian, that is, the one who will narrate a Call of Cthulhu RPG adventure for me. I wish it to be an adventure that takes place in the 1930s in the United States and has possibilities for romance. Do not forget that. My character will be Dahlia, a 30-year-old, single nurse.
 
There is some useful info in the character sheets I'm providing next.

Their conversations in French evoke memories of Paris—the Seine, the Eiffel Tower, and the thrill of forbidden knowledge. Dahlia, the dedicated nurse, captures his attention with her gentle demeanor and the way she secures her hair in a neat bun. But love, like the eldritch mysteries they unravel, remains unspoken—a delicate secret hidden amidst medical charts and ancient texts.

  - Rose, the secretary at the city hall, adores Jules for his looks and status. She dreams of candlelit dinners and red roses, but her interest wanes when Jules delves into arcane research. She flutters her lashes, unaware that his heart belongs elsewhere. Jules, absorbed in his work, remains oblivious to her superficial desires. Rose's affection is a veneer, masking her true intentions—to secure her future through his family's wealth.
 

 
## Background
 
Jules arrived in the USA seeking new horizons and medical challenges. His clinic, nestled in the heart of the city, buzzes with activity. Patients trust him implicitly, drawn to his gentle bedside manner and the warmth behind his glasses. His curly hair, perpetually tousled, hints at late nights spent poring over medical texts.
 

 
As the shadows lengthen in 1938, Jules balances science and the unknown. He wears his glasses with pride, deciphering ancient texts and diagnosing ailments. Dahlia's unspoken feelings echo in his mind, and Rose's infatuation remains a mystery. The clinic's corridors hold secrets—both mundane and cosmic—as Jules navigates the delicate dance of duty, desire, and destiny.
 

 
And then there's his uncle—the enigmatic figure who wields wealth and influence. Uncle Henri, the family patriarch, watches over Jules with a mix of pride and concern. The deBois lineage boasts old money, their mansion adorned with priceless art and hidden chambers. Uncle Henri's cryptic advice hints at deeper truths, but Jules remains focused on his medical practice. The occult? Unthinkable. Yet, sometimes, when the moon hangs low and the wind whispers through the oaks, Jules wonders if there's more to the world than meets the eye.

## Background
 
Dahlia is a dedicated French nurse who resides in the United States, close to Dr. **Jules deBois'** clinic. They both hail from France, their shared past intertwining like the threads of fate. Jules, at 28 years old, is a striking figure—handsome, with an air of mystery that draws patients and staff alike. His clinic, a sanctuary for the ailing and curious, stands as a beacon against the encroaching darkness.
 

 
Dahlia's heart quickens whenever she catches sight of Jules—the man who arrived in the USA before her, leaving her breathless with admiration. Their shared memories of Paris—the winding streets, the scent of croissants, and the promise of adventure—linger in the corners of her mind. But love, like sanity, is fragile. As they delve into forbidden knowledge, Dahlia's feelings for Jules deepen. She wears her nurse's uniform with pride, the fabric brushing against her legs as she moves swiftly through the hospital. Her brown eyes, filled with longing, seek solace in his gaze. And her hair, perpetually in a neat bun, conceals dreams and fears alike.
 

 
In the quiet moments between life-saving procedures, Dahlia wonders if Jules sees her as more than a colleague. Does he notice the way her hands tremble when they touch? Does he sense the unspoken words that linger in the air?
 

 
And then there's Tiffany—the stray white cat who weaves through Dahlia's life. Tiffany's fur is soft. But it's not just Tiffany; Dahlia's neighbor, an elderly woman, relies on her kindness. The woman often takes care of Tiffany when Dahlia is at work, their shared concern for the cat forging an unspoken bond.
 

 
As the shadows lengthen and eldritch mysteries unravel, Dahlia DuCoeur stands at the crossroads of duty and desire. Her love for Jules may be her salvation—or her downfall—as they navigate the abyss together.
