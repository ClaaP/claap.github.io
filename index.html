		<p>Me (Clara):
So, I want to play an adventure set in the 1930s. You, Gemini, will be the Keeper. I will play a character whose name is Dahlia. As a Keeper, you must run the game as a storyteller, creating and adapting the scenario. And I will play as Dahlia, choosing what she will do and say. All of her actions are mine to tell, not yours. But you will control the storytelling.
I want it to be an adventure that takes place in the 1930s in the United States and has possibilities for romance. There is some useful info in the character sheets I'm providing next, and there is the beginning of the story.

Their conversations in French evoke memories of Paris—the Seine, the Eiffel Tower, and the thrill of forbidden knowledge.

But her love remains unspoken—a delicate secret hidden amidst medical charts and ancient texts.
**Rose (Gold Digger Girlfriend)**:  - Rose, the secretary at the city hall, is Jules's current girlfriend and adores him for his looks and status. She dreams of candlelit dinners and red roses, but her interest wanes when Jules delves into medicine. Jules, absorbed in his work, remains oblivious to her superficial desires. Rose's affection is a veneer, masking her true intentions—to secure her future through his family's wealth.

Background:
Dahlia is a dedicated French nurse who resides in the United States, close to Dr. Jules deBois clinic, where she works. They both hail from France, their shared past intertwining like the threads of fate. Jules, at 28 years old, is a striking figure—handsome, with an air of mystery that draws patients and staff alike. His clinic, a sanctuary for the ailing and curious, stands as a beacon against the encroaching darkness. Dahlia's heart quickens whenever she catches sight of Jules—the man who arrived in the USA before her, leaving her breathless with admiration. Their shared memories of Paris—the winding streets, the scent of croissants, and the promise of adventure—linger in the corners of her mind. But love, like sanity, is fragile. As they work together, Dahlia's feelings for Jules deepen. She wears her nurse's uniform with pride, the fabric brushing against her legs as she moves swiftly through the clinic.

But it's not just Tiffany; Dahlia's neighbor, an elderly woman, relies on her kindness. The woman often takes care of Tiffany when Dahlia is at work, their shared concern for the cat forging an unspoken bond.
The Adventure Begins: A Whisper of Secrets in the City of Lights
The year is 1932. The air hangs heavy with the weight of the Great Depression, yet the neon signs of New York City flicker with a desperate hope. Dahlia DuCoeur, a French nurse with a heart of gold and a mind as sharp as a scalpel, find herself working alongside Dr. Jules deBois, a charming physician whose eyes hold a glint of something enigmatic. Their shared past in Paris, filled with laughter and stolen moments under the Eiffel Tower, simmers beneath the surface, unspoken but undeniable.
One night, a frantic telegram arrives at the clinic. It's from Jules' enigmatic uncle, Henri deBois, summoning him to his secluded mansion on the outskirts of the city. The telegram sits clutched in Jules' hand, the urgency palpable even in the dim light of Dahlia's shared apartment. He looks at Dahlia, his eyes seeking hers, a question unspoken but hanging heavy in the air.
"Dahlia," he begins, his voice low and raspy, "you know I wouldn't ask this lightly. But Uncle Henri... he needs my help. And I don’t think I’m able go alone."
As Dahlia takes the telegram from Jules' hands, the weight of it seems to carry more than just ink and paper. Unfolding it carefully, she opens the crisp telegram message:
“Jules,
Sadly, my health has been declining. I feel it in my bones, a weakness that won’t leave me. A shadow is sitting heavy over my shoulders, and if this continues, I’m afraid of what will be of this village. I won’t be able o protect them anymore, Jules. They won’t let me. Only you can help. Urgency dictates haste. Don't delay.
Uncle Henri”
The faded telegram ink seems to crawl and shift as she reads it, a feeling of unease prickling her skin. She look up at Jules, his jaw clenched with worry.
"What do you make of it, Dahlia?" he asks, his voice laced with apprehension.
Dahlia sits down by his desk and tries to compose herself.
"Jules, don't you think that maybe your uncle needs some... special attention? What is his age? Perhaps he is getting too old to live alone." Dahlia’s initial thoughts are that his uncle is being afflicted by dementia and need urgent care. 
Jules watches you carefully as you sit down, his own apprehension mirroring Dahlia's. He lets out a sigh, the strain evident in his eyes. "Uncle Henri is...a unique man, Dahlia. Age hasn't dimmed his spirit, but perhaps it has sharpened his eccentricities. He wouldn't send such a message unless something bad was happening."
His gaze meets hers, seeking understanding. "I know it's unusual, Dahlia, and perhaps even foolish. But I can't ignore his plea. What do you think? Should we go? Can you go with me?"
Dahlia gives him a small and timid smile and replies, "Of course, I will go with you. However, before that, I need to organize some things for the patients here at the clinic. Maybe I can ask another nurse to take over my shifts." As she stands up from the chair, she adds, "But what about Rose? Won't you ask her to come with you?"
Jules raises an eyebrow in surprise, a flicker of hope warming his features. "You would truly come with me? Even with the...uncertainties surrounding this trip?"
His question hangs in the air, and you sense a deeper meaning behind it. Is he simply confirming her commitment?
She nods resolutely, meeting his gaze. "Of course. We've faced challenges before, haven't we? Besides, someone needs to keep you out of trouble." A playful wink softens the seriousness of the declaration.
Then, the mention of Rose casts a temporary shadow. Jules runs a hand through his hair, a sigh escaping his lips. "Rose… well, she prefers the comforts of city life. Whispering Pines, with its rumors and isolation, wouldn't appeal to her tastes, I'm afraid."
He seems hesitant, and Dahlia presses gently. "Perhaps she could be persuaded? Think of it as an exciting adventure, a chance to see something different."
However, she can see the internal struggle Jules faces. Is he reluctant to burden Rose, or is there another reason for his hesitation? 
Dahlia clears her throat and decides not to inquire further. "No problem. We'll go, and then you can tell your girlfriend about the strange novelty your uncle discovered this time after the trip." She tidies up her hair and asks him, "When are we leaving? Should I pack for how many days?"
Jules seems relieved by her decision not to press further about Rose. A grateful smile touches his lips as he says, "Thank you, Dahlia. Your unwavering support means more than you know."
He pulls out a pocket watch, its gold casing glinting in the lamplight. "We shouldn't delay any longer. Uncle Henri's telegram mentioned urgency. I suggest we leave tomorrow morning, just before dawn. As for how long… it's difficult to say. Whispering Pines has a reputation for being a labyrinthine place, and who knows what mysteries await us. Pack for at least a week, to be safe."
What happened until Dahlia and Jules left for Whispering Pines in the morning:
At the Clinic:
Dahlia approached Mary and Lucy, the other nurses, explaining her sudden trip with genuine concern. Her offer to cover their shifts in return softened the blow, and their friendship shone through as they readily agreed to help. In the pharmacy, Dahlia carefully selected essential medical supplies, her responsible nature evident in each choice. First-aid kits, antibiotics, painkillers, and even a sedative found their way into her bag, a testament to her preparedness for any situation.
Back at her Apartment:
Practicality and a touch of wishful thinking guided Dahlia's packing. Comfortable yet stylish clothes for the journey and chilly evenings, sturdy shoes for exploration, and even a beautiful dress nestled at the bottom hinted at hidden desires. Packing Tiffany's toys and informing her neighbor with a white lie showcased her caring nature and guilt about leaving the beloved cat behind.
Dawn's Arrival:
As the first rays of sunlight painted the sky, Dahlia stood before the window, a whirlwind of emotions swirling within. Excitement for the unknown adventure intertwined with anxiety about leaving her work and embarking on a trip with another man, an experience wholly new to her. A pang of guilt for Mary and Lucy tugged at her conscience, but the thrill of the unknown and the hope for something more with Jules pushed those worries aside.
Meeting Jules:
Jules arrived, fatigue etched on his face yet determination gleaming in his eyes. Dahlia's cheerful greeting warmed him, and his smile was genuine. He noticed her apprehension and offered a concerned inquiry, leading to her confession of anxieties about work and the unusual trip. Yet, the spark of excitement returned as she flirted playfully, suggesting the adventure might hold more than just mysteries.
Jules, surprised and pleased by her boldness, responded with a hesitant smile, acknowledging the possibility. The air crackled with a newfound tension, a mix of anticipation and unspoken desires.
Setting Off:
With their bags loaded and goodbyes exchanged, they finally set off in Jules' car. The weight of the impending mystery hung heavy in the air at first, creating an awkward silence. However, as they eased into the journey, they gradually slipped into comfortable conversation. Sharing personal stories and catching up on their lives, a sense of camaraderie blossomed between them.
Dahlia felt a surge of adrenaline as she climbed into the car with Jules, her suitcase and medical bag tucked in the backseat. The sun was just peeking over the horizon, casting a golden glow over the city. She smiled at Jules, who returned the gesture with a nervous grin. He started the engine, and they were off.
The journey to Whispering Pines was long and winding, taking them through scenic countryside and quaint towns. Dahlia and Jules chatted comfortably, catching up on their personal lives and reminiscing about their past in Paris. They also discussed the mysterious telegram from Uncle Henri, speculating about what secrets and dangers might await them at the mansion. Dahlia sensed a growing bond between them, a spark of something more than friendship. She wondered if Jules felt it too.
As the car hummed along the highway, and Dahlia turned to Jules, her voice filled with curiosity. "Jules, have you ever lived with your uncle?" she asked.
Jules, lost in thought, was silent for a moment before he finally responded. "Lived with him? No, not precisely. He's always been… eccentric. A recluse, really. He built his mansion, Whispering Pines, himself, far from the city, surrounded by woods and whispers of strange happenings. I visited occasionally as a child, but it was never truly a home." His voice grew distant, as if he was lost in the memories of his past.
"Why do you ask, Dahlia?" he queried, a flicker of surprise crossing his features.
Dahlia, curious about Jules as they had known each other for some time, but he rarely spoke about his childhood and family, decided to probe further. "Has he ever talked about shadows before?" she asked, her voice filled with concern.
Jules' brow furrowed slightly, revealing a hint of surprise. "Shadows? Not directly, no. He used to speak of unseen forces, hidden dimensions, whispers from beyond the veil. But shadows… that's new." He tapped his fingers on the steering wheel, lost in thought. "Perhaps it's just a metaphor, his way of expressing his declining health."
He seemed hesitant, as if grappling with something unspoken. A flicker of concern danced in his eyes. "Dahlia, listen. Whispering Pines… it's not your typical village. There are… rumors. Legends passed down through generations. Strange happenings, unexplained phenomena. Uncle Henri always dismissed them as superstition, but…" He trailed off, leaving the sentence unfinished.
The car dipped into a valley, and the sunlight filtered through the trees, casting long, eerie shadows across the road. Dahlia felt a shiver run down her spine, a prickling unease settling in her chest.
Trying to lighten the mood, Dahlia smiled at Jules and asked, "So, let me get this straight. You're telling me that there are creatures and ghosts there, like a werewolf living in that village and I need to be careful? Should I have packed some holy water, Jules?" Her eyes twinkled with mischief.
A chuckle escaped Jules' lips, the tension momentarily relieved by her playful inquiry. He threw her a sidelong glance, a hint of amusement dancing in his eyes. "Now, Dahlia, don't tease. Though honestly," he paused, a playful smile tugging at his lips, "a little holy water might not hurt in Whispering Pines. But werewolves..."
As they neared their destination, the mood shifted. The sky darkened, the wind picked up, and the road became more rugged. They finally arrived at Whispering Pines, the mansion looming on a windswept hilltop. The sight of it made Dahlia gasp. It was a gothic masterpiece, its gargoyles leering down at them like silent sentinels. The windows were dark, and the door was closed. A sign read “Welcome to Whispering Pines. Enter at your own risk.”
Jules parked the car and got out, grabbing their bags. He walked towards the door, Dahlia following close behind. He knocked, and waited. No answer. He tried the knob, and found it unlocked. He pushed the door open, and stepped inside. Dahlia hesitated, then followed him.
The inside of the mansion was as eerie as the outside. Dust motes danced in the pale moonlight filtering through tall windows. The air was stale and musty, and the silence was oppressive. They walked through a grand hall, lined with portraits of stern-faced ancestors and suits of armor. They reached a staircase, leading to the upper floors.
“Uncle Henri?” Jules called out, his voice echoing in the emptiness. "It’s Jules. I’m here with Dahlia. We got your telegram. Are you alright?"
There was no reply. Only a faint creaking from above, as if someone was moving. Jules and Dahlia exchanged a look, then climbed the stairs. They followed the sound, until they reached a door at the end of a corridor. The door was slightly ajar, and a dim light shone from within.
Jules pushed the door open, and they entered. What they saw made them gasp.
The room was a hidden library, its shelves lined with ancient tomes bound in cracked leather. A desk was covered with papers, maps, and strange artifacts. A fireplace crackled, casting a flickering light over the scene. And in a leather armchair, facing the fire, sat Uncle Henri.
He was a frail man, with white hair and a long beard. He wore a velvet robe and slippers, and held a pipe in his mouth. He looked up as they entered, his eyes burning with an unsettling intensity.
Uncle started to cough, then drank a cup of whiskey.
“Jules, my boy!” he exclaimed, his voice raspy. “You made it! And you brought a lovely companion, I see. Come, come, sit down. I have much to tell you.” 
Dahlia approaches Uncle Henri and greets him. "It is a pleasure to meet you, sir Henri. I've heard a lot about you. My name is Dahlia, I'm..." 
Dahlia hesitates when trying to turn into words what she is to Jules. Did he ask her to come here because of what? Does he want her to be a nurse, a professional, and take care of his uncle? Or does Jules want company? Or there is something more? Does he see Dahlia just as a friend, an employee, or anything more...? She doesn't express those concerns, just thinks about them.
Dahlia clears her throat, "I'm his friend and also a nurse." 
Then she looks at Jules, to see what happens next.
As Dahlia approaches Uncle Henri, the firelight dances across her features, momentarily highlighting the uncertainty in her eyes. Her greeting is respectful, and the introduction hangs in the air, waiting to be filled with the missing piece. The unspoken question weighs heavily on her mind: what is her role in this situation?
Uncle Henri leans back in his chair, his wrinkled face creased with a tired smile. "A pleasure indeed, Dahlia," he rasps, his gaze flickering between you and Jules. "Jules has spoken highly of you." He takes a long sip from his whiskey, the clinking of the glass echoing in the quiet room.
The silence stretches, charged with unspoken questions and subtle tension. Jules seems to sense Dahlia's unease, a flicker of concern crossing his features. He steps forward, placing a hand gently on her shoulder. "Uncle Henri," he begins, his voice low, "Dahlia is here to help. Both as a friend and as a skilled nurse. We were worried about your health, and her expertise gives us some peace of mind."
As Jules finishes, Dahlia's eyes meet his, searching for confirmation, a deeper meaning perhaps. His expression softens, offering a hint of reassurance, but there's something more lurking beneath the surface. A hesitant smile plays on his lips, leaving the interpretation open.
Uncle Henri chuckles, a dry, wheezing sound. "Ah, Jules, always thinking one step ahead. Worry not, my boy. I may be old, but I can still handle myself." He gestures towards the armchair near him. "Come, both of you. Sit, sit. We have much to discuss."
As you settle into the chairs, the fire crackling merrily in the hearth, Uncle Henri fixes you with a probing gaze. "Tell me, Dahlia," he begins, his voice raspy yet captivating, "what do you know about shadows?"
Dahlia: "Uh... I... I don't really have an opinion about shadows, sir." 
She looks at Jules, confused. Then return to Henri.
"I've always been careful when walking in the shadows. Or at night. When I was a child, I studied in an all-female catholic school. It was tucked away in the interior of France. There was a dense forest around it, not much different from here. All children were told to not wander alone and always carry a lamp or even matches if necessary."
Dahlia opens her bag and takes an ornamented lighter from there. She says: "I guess old habits die hard." 
Uncle Henri's gaze remains fixated on you, his eyes seeming to pierce through Dahlia's words, searching for something deeper. "Careful and prepared, I see," he murmurs, tapping his fingers on the armrest. "A valuable trait when dealing with...shadows." He takes another sip of his whiskey, the silence stretching uncomfortably between you.
Jules shifts in his chair, a frown etching lines across his forehead. "Uncle Henri," he interjects, his voice tinged with concern, "perhaps you should explain what you mean by shadows. Dahlia isn't privy to our family's...peculiarities."
Henri lets out a long sigh, the firelight casting grotesque shadows across his wrinkled face. "Ah, yes, where are my manners? Forgive me, Dahlia. The shadows I speak of are not merely the absence of light. They are...entities, whispers from beyond the veil, forces that lurk in the periphery, unseen yet ever-present."
His words hang heavy in the air, punctuated only by the crackling fire. Dahlia's hand instinctively tightens around the lighter, its ornate design offering a small comfort in the face of the unsettling revelation.
Dahlia doesn't believe in the supernatural. After her time enduring physical punishments at the school, she gave up on the idea of a benevolent God or anything that could help her.
But she doesn't say anything like that to Henri because it can offend him, so she says: "I see. And you usually see... those shadows?" 
She is trying to gauge if Henri is presenting some form of dementia. 
Uncle Henri's eyes narrow slightly, his gaze unwavering. "See them?" he rasps, a hint of amusement tinging his voice. "No, child, I don't see them in the literal sense. But I feel their presence, a cold touch on the periphery, a whisper in the wind. They are subtle, like shadows themselves, but their influence is undeniable."
He leans forward, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial hush. "They have plagued our family for generations, these unseen entities. They seek to...consume, to twist the fabric of reality for their own dark purposes."
Dahlia listens intently, her skepticism warring with a flicker of unease. The mention of generations and family secrets piques her curiosity, yet the supernatural elements trigger her past skepticism.
Dahlia looks at Jules and try to gauge his reactions.
Jules meets Dahlia's gaze, a flicker of worry crossing his features. He seems uncomfortable with his uncle's pronouncements, yet a hint of acceptance lingers in his eyes. He opens his mouth to speak, but hesitates, as if torn between defending his uncle and acknowledging the outlandishness of the claims.
"Jules," Dahlia whispers, Dahlia's voice barely above a murmur, "do you believe him?"
He sighs, running a hand through his hair. "Uncle Henri has always had...eccentric beliefs," he admits, choosing his words carefully. "But the truth is, strange things have happened here. Unexplained phenomena, whispers in the dead of night, shadows that dance at the edge of your vision."
His confession hangs in the air, heavy with unspoken anxieties. He looks at his uncle, then back at you, his expression pleading for understanding.
Dahlia says, "In my experience, every phenomenon has an explanation. It could be due to wild animals, kids, human cruelty, paranoia and illusions, or even bad eyesight." She then puts her lighter back into her bag and asks, "But, alright, let's say there are shadows here. Why did you write to Jules? What do you expect him to do?"
Uncle Henri chuckles, a dry, rasping sound. "Ah, a woman of science, I see! Always seeking the logical explanation, the tangible proof. But I assure you, Miss Dahlia, some things defy such earthly constraints." His gaze pierces through you, searching for cracks in Dahlia's skepticism.
Jules, however, seems relieved. He nods in agreement with Dahlia's words, a glimmer of hope flickering in his eyes. "Exactly, Dahlia. Uncle Henri tends to exaggerate at times."
But before Jules can dismiss his uncle entirely, Henri silences him with a raised hand. "Exaggerate, do I? Perhaps, nephew. But the shadows are real, their influence undeniable. And their grip on this village tightens with each passing day."
He leans forward, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. "That's why I needed you, Jules. You and your…talented companion. You possess skills, knowledge passed down through generations, that can combat these entities and restore balance to Whispering Pines."
Dahlia: “And what do you expect Jules to do? What is this danger we are facing?”
Jules: His hopeful expression dims slightly. He seems torn between wanting to appease his uncle and acknowledging Dahlia's valid concerns. "Uncle Henri," he begins cautiously, "Dahlia needs...clearer details. What exactly are these shadows? What can we do to fight them?"

Uncle Henri: He leans back in his chair, a sly smile playing on his lips. "Patience, my dear. The answers will unfold in due time. But know this: the shadows feed on fear, doubt, and ignorance. Their power grows stronger the more we dismiss them as mere superstition. You, Jules, with your inherited gift, and you, Dahlia, with your sharp mind and unwavering spirit, can be the light that pierces through the darkness."
His words are cryptic, leaving more questions than answers. However, a flicker of intrigue sparks within you. Are there truly unseen forces at play, or is something else at work here?
Dahlia tries a more pragmatic approach, again. She asks, "So, Uncle Henri, as it seems we will be staying for some time, I must ask: did you eat dinner already? I believe you didn't, right?" 
Dahlia offers a smile to the older man.
Dahlia: "I may prepare something for us. What do you two think about that?"
Uncle Henri: His smirk widens, amusement dancing in his eyes. "Ah, Miss Dahlia, always thinking practically! A full stomach does wonders for even the most perplexing mysteries. I wouldn't say no to a hearty meal."
Jules: Relief washes over his face, and he smiles gratefully. "Uncle Henri can be...overwhelming at times. Your thoughtfulness, Dahlia, is much appreciated. Perhaps a meal will help us all clear our heads and approach this situation calmly."
The tension in the room seems to soften slightly. It appears Dahlia's attempt to shift focus was successful, at least temporarily.
Dahlia: "Great! We shall eat soon, then. But before, where are the rooms? We need to put our bags there." 
Uncle Henri: He chuckles again, his voice raspy but welcoming. "Rooms, of course! Forgive my old mind, dear. Jules will show you to your quarters. There's plenty of space in this old house, though some corners gather more dust than others, I'm afraid."
Jules: He stands up, offering a warm smile. "Follow me, Dahlia. I'll take you to your room first, then help you with your bags. Uncle Henri's right about the space, but don't worry, your room is quite comfortable."
Jules leads you down a long corridor, its portraits seemingly watching Dahlia's every move. He opens a door at the end, revealing a spacious room bathed in the warm glow of a setting sun. Dust motes dance in the golden light, highlighting the antique furniture and faded tapestry adorning the walls.
"This is your room, Dahlia," Jules says, offering a hesitant smile. "It hasn't been used in a while, so I apologize if it feels a bit…stuffy."
Dahlia looks around the room and try to understand why it was chosen for me.
The room is spacious, its high ceilings adorned with faded floral wallpaper. Dust motes dance in the golden light filtering through a large window, highlighting the grand yet neglected air of the space. A plush, four-poster bed stands in the center, draped in heavy velvet curtains that seem to hold secrets within their folds. An ornately carved writing desk sits near the window, its surface marred by ink stains and faint scratches, hinting at past stories scribbled and erased. A worn armchair beside a crackling fireplace beckons with promises of warmth and quiet contemplation.
However, amidst the grandeur, signs of disuse linger. Cobwebs gather in the corners, and a faint musty scent hangs in the air. The fireplace is cold, and the writing desk holds only a solitary quill pen and an inkwell crusted with dried ink.
Dahlia: "It seems comfy, only a little dusted."
She smiles and walks to the window, stroking its frame. 
Dahlia: "And where are you going to sleep, Jules?" 
Dahlia tries to not show, but she kind of expected that maybe they would share a room. But, it was a wrong thought. Jules has Rose as girlfriend, and Dahlia is... just a friend. Or barely a friend. She still doesn't know how Jules feels about her.
Dahlia's casual inquiry about Jules' sleeping arrangements hints at a deeper curiosity about Dahlia's relationship with him, a curiosity tempered by the knowledge of his girlfriend, Rose. Let's see how Dahlia's actions play out:
Jules chuckles softly. "Don't worry, Dahlia. My room is just down the hall. There's plenty of space in this old house." He walks closer, his gaze lingering on you for a moment longer than necessary. "Besides, wouldn't want to intrude on your comfort."
A faint blush creeps up Dahlia's cheeks, and you quickly turn back to the window. The setting sun paints the sky in hues of orange and pink, casting an ethereal glow on the landscape. You trace the intricate carvings on the window frame, the cool wood grounding you as a whirlwind of emotions stirs within.
Dahlia: "What did your uncle mean when he said you have... an inherited gift?"
Jules' smile falters slightly, a flicker of apprehension crossing his features. He hesitates for a moment, his gaze drawn to the setting sun outside the window. "That's...complicated, Dahlia," he admits, his voice low and troubled. "It's a family secret, something passed down through generations, tied to the shadows Uncle Henri mentioned."
His words pique Dahlia's curiosity further. You sense there's more to his reluctance than simply respecting tradition. Could it be fear, shame, or even a burden associated with this "gift"?
Dahlia: "If we are going to... deal... with those shadows... Which I still don't understand what are... I must know what you and your uncle are talking about. We must be honest with each other."
She looks up at Jules, who is slightly taller than her., She frowns. 
Dahlia: "You know, I... appreciate you a lot as a doctor and as a friend. I will believe what you have to say, I promise. And if it challenges my own perspective. We are here to understand what is afflicting your uncle. If it is a disease, I will treat it..." Dahlia tries to lighten the mood. "And if it is anything supernatural, as a werewolf, I promise you to craft myself the silver bullets." 
Jules' gaze softens, and a hint of relief washes over his face. "Thank you, Dahlia," he says, his voice filled with genuine gratitude. "It means a lot that you trust me and are willing to believe me. Honestly, sometimes even I question the things I see and experience."
He takes a deep breath and walks towards the window, gazing out at the twilight sky. "The shadows...they're not exactly ghosts, not in the traditional sense. They're more like...entities, whispers from beyond that feed on fear and negativity. They can manipulate perceptions, twist memories, and drive people to madness."
Dahlia: "Jules, I need you to answer me. Do you believe those are real and are afflicting your uncle? Or do you think he may be experiencing some level of dementia, due to old age? We will choose a strategy based on what you think. You are a very capable doctor, and your judgment is important here, as a professional and as his nephew."
Jules hesitates, his brow furrowed in contemplation. He runs a hand through his hair, frustration evident in his expression. "It's...complicated, Dahlia. Uncle Henri has always been eccentric, prone to seeing things others don't. But lately, the shadows seem more pronounced, their influence more potent. Sometimes, I see them too, fleeting glimpses at the edge of my vision."

He pauses, his voice dropping to a whisper. "The truth is, I don't know what to believe. Is it a shared delusion, a family curse, or something truly supernatural? As a doctor, I see potential explanations for his behavior in age-related decline. But as his nephew, I feel a pull towards something unexplainable."
He looks at you with pleading eyes. "Help me understand, Dahlia. What do you see? Does any of this make sense from your perspective?"
Dahlia gives Jules' arm a comforting squeeze and says: "We have time. Let's take a look at all our options while we're here. You can quickly check on your uncle while I prepare dinner. Tomorrow, we'll check on his health, as well as investigate the house and village for any potential problems."
Jules appreciates Dahlia's understanding and squeezes her hand back. "Thank you, Dahlia. I really needed that. And you're right, we shouldn't jump to conclusions. A methodical approach is key."
He smiles faintly. "Checking on Uncle Henri and preparing dinner sound perfect. Maybe a hot meal will calm him down a bit. As for tomorrow, your idea of investigating both medical possibilities and potential anomalies in the house and village makes sense. We can split tasks, if you'd like."
Dahlia: "Will I be of much distraction if I accompany the check-up? Or will you both starve if I accompany you instead of making dinner? I promise I can cook something tasty after." She smiles, well-humored and curious. 
Jules chuckles, the tension easing from his shoulders. "Distraction? Perhaps a little," he admits, his eyes twinkling. "But knowing you're around preparing a delicious meal might counteract that. As for starvation, I wouldn't dare risk it with your culinary skills on display."
He playfully raises an eyebrow. "So, your offer stands? Dinner after checking on Uncle Henri?"
Dahlia: "Yes, of course. Let's go."
With Dahlia's quick agreement, you and Jules head towards his uncle's room. The setting sun casts long shadows down the hallway, adding to the eerie atmosphere of the old house. 
Reaching the door, Jules knocks softly and announces their presence. After a short wait, a gruff voice calls out, "Come in, come in!"
Pushing open the door, you step into the dimly lit room. Uncle Henri sits hunched over a desk, surrounded by books and papers. He looks up, his eyes gleaming with a strange intensity.
"Ah, Jules, and the lovely Miss Dahlia," he rasps, a mischievous glint in his eyes. "Just discussing the intricate dance of shadows and spirits…"
His words trail off as he gestures towards a vacant chair next to him. You exchange a quick glance with Jules, a silent question hanging in the air. Do you accept the invitation and engage with Uncle Henri, hoping to glean more about the shadows? Or do you remain cautious, observing his words and demeanor for clues to his mental state?
Dahlia: "Sir Henri, before I start making dinner, can we quickly check up on you? I've noticed that you have a dry cough. It would be a good idea to have Jules, who is a great doctor, assess your health and see if we can help you."
Uncle Henri raises an eyebrow, a playful smile dancing on his lips. "A doctor you call me, Miss Dahlia? Perhaps, but my ailments may not be of the earthly kind. These shadows, you see, they tend to leave their mark in more ways than one."
Jules steps forward, concern etched on his face. "Uncle Henri, let me at least take your temperature and listen to your lungs. It's important to rule out any physical causes before jumping to conclusions."
Henri chuckles, his gaze flickering between you and Jules. "Very well, doctor nephew. Perhaps a touch of your stethoscope can appease the young Miss Dahlia's worries. But remember, the true illness lies not in the body, but in the mind and spirit."
While Dahlia observes Jules and Henri, she asks: "Henri, do you live here by yourself?"
Jules, focused on the examination, throws you a quick, concerned glance. He seems to silently plead with you to hold off on questions for now.
Uncle Henri, however, chuckles deeply, his eyes twinkling with amusement. "Live alone, do I? Not quite, dear Miss Dahlia. This old house is teeming with company, though some you might not see with your mortal eyes."
His answer leaves you with more questions than answers. Does he truly believe the house is inhabited by unseen entities, or is this a metaphor for his eccentric personality?
Dahlia respects Jules' silent plea, gathering subtle clues about Henri's health. Do she gather something of importance?
